# Experiment Files for "Improving Highway Traffic Performance: Merging Pattern Design of a Departure Zone After Tollbooths or ETC"
There are three groups: 1) Group 1, 2) Group 2, and 3) Group 3.
Group 1 is for the simulations in normal situations. Group 2 is for the simulations with higher values of some parameters. Group 3 is for the simulations with smaller values of some parameters. Each group includes eight sub-groups, corresponding to the eight merging patterns in the paper. In each sub-group, run XXX.INP to get the results.
